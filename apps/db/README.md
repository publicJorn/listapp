# Database for listapp

This currently doesn't do much. The db is created by TypeORM in `be-nest`, which was easy(ier) to follow along with a tutorial.

May be better to create it as an app.

`init.sql` is reserved for docker startup, but is currently empty. TypeORM seed files should go in `./seed`, which for now is also empty.
